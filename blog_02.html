                                        understanding of what cryptocurrency is. Cryptocurrency is a digital  or
                                        virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptography for security.  It is
                                        decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a central  authority like
                                        traditional currencies (e.g., dollars or euros).  Bitcoin, the most famous
                                        cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009 by an  anonymous entity known as
                                        Satoshi Nakamoto.

                                        cryptocurrency. This ledger is secure, transparent, and  immutable. The

                                        in a secure and decentralized manner.

                                        various cryptocurrencies. Some popular exchanges include  Coinbase, Binance,
